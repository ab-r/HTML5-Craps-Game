This is an html5 implemetation of a craps game.

Rules of the game:

The player throws a pair of dice.
The sum of the two top faces is what matters.
If the player  throws a 7 or 11 on the first throw, he/she wins.
If the sum is 2, 3 or 12, he/she loses.

In all other cases, the sum is recorded as the player's point, and follow up throw is required. On follow up throws, a throw of 7 loses, and a throw of player's point wins. For anything else, the game continues with followup throw rules.
